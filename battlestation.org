* Battlestation

This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine.

** Firewall/router (shepard)

I built my own firewall/router to learn more about networking, originally using the hardware that became liara. 
About a year later I replaced it with a [[http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16813128585][Celeron combo]], primarily because I wanted to use the E350 
as a media PC (and it was on sale). I also found a [[http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16811128072][perfect case]] for it. Besides a short experiment with
[[http://www.pfsense.org/][pfSense]] (which worked well, but I was offput by the web UI), shepard has run stock [[http://www.openbsd.org/][OpenBSD]], which has been a 
pleasure to work with. pf is a fantastic firewall, and the [[http://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html][OpenBSD FAQs]] and man pages are some of the best 
documentation I've come across. I've learned a lot about networking and server management thanks to it.

** NAS (edi)

Edi was built to address the fact that I use multiple computers and operating systems on a daily basis.
[[http://www.freenas.org/][FreeNAS]] has been wonderful to use, and in my opinion easily matches what the commercial NAS products
have to offer. The hardware is based on an [[http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16813157247][AMD E350 combo]] with 8GB RAM (zfs likes to maintain a large
memory cache) and two WD 2TB drives (mirrored).

This system also hosts glyph. a FreeBSD jail (easily set up with FreeNAS) that primarily runs my database
servers (currently [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]], [[http://www.mongodb.org/][MongoDB]], and [[http://camlistore.org/][Camlistore]]).

** Desktop (wrex)

My current desktop/gaming machine has evolved over several generations; all that remains of the original 
are the optical drive and the case (it still has a 3.5" floppy drive, but that hasn't been connected in 
years). The current hardware is getting a bit old, but it's still performing well for what I do. Wrex drives
all three monitors typically, with worse-case load being three [[http://www.eveonline.com/][EVE]] clients running at high quality.

   - 16 GB DDR3

** Development (liara)

Liara has had a tumultuous past, originally acting as my router. It is a [[http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16856119057][Foxconn barebones E350]]. Now I use it 
whenever I want to play around with an OS/distro "on the metal" instead of in a VM. Currently it's running 
[[http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/][SteamOS]], although the E350 isn't powerful enough to handle most games. It also makes a great monitor stand 
for the fixed-height ASUS monitor (the other one is adjustable - I plan to get monitor mounts soon TM).

** Laptop (garrus)

My current portable machine (which I use for most development, when I can't "borrow" a MacBook from the office) 
is a [[http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/05/dell-inspiron-14z-review/][Dell Inspiron 14z (2011)]]. It has had a couple operating systems on it during its life, and currently dual-
boots Windows XP and [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]], the latter of which is used 90% of the time.

** Consoles

I have both an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3. Most of my social gaming happens on the 360, while the
PS3 is used for its exclusive games (e.g. /The Last of Us/) or its superior Netflix interface. I have no 
intention to get an Xbox One or a PS4, and will likely focus on PC gaming when the 360 and PS3 become obsolete. 

I quickly picked up a Chromecast when it was released, and for $35 it is well worth it. I gave up on watching
Netflix on it due to various quirks, but regularly use it for music.

** Video

I have three primary monitors, acquired incrementally over the last few years. The latest acquisition,
and centerpiece, is a [[http://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u2713hm/pd][Dell U2713HM]] 27" ultrasharp. Flanking it are two ASUS 24" monitors. I also
have a [[http://www.benq.us/product/projector/w1070/][BenQ W1070]] 1080p projector, which is driven (along with a mixed bag of speakers) 
by a [[http://usa.denon.com/us/product/pages/productdetail.aspx?catid%3Davreceivers(denonna)&pid%3Davr3313ci(denonna)][Denon AVR-3313CI]] receiver. The primary (zone 1) output also goes to the Dell monitor. Zone 2 
of the receiver goes to the left monitor. The flexibility enabled by this receiver is amazing!
