<h2 id="toc_0">Firewall/router (shepard)</h2>

<p>I built my own firewall/router to learn more about networking,
originally using the hardware that became liara. About a year later I
replaced it with a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16813128585">Celeron
combo</a>,
primarily because I wanted to use the E350 as a media PC (and it was on
sale). I also found a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16811128072">perfect
case</a>
for it. Besides a short experiment with
<a href="http://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> (which worked well, but I was offput
by the web UI), shepard has run stock
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>, which has been a pleasure to work
with. pf is a fantastic firewall, and the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/index.html">OpenBSD
FAQs</a> and man pages are some of
the best documentation I&rsquo;ve come across. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about
networking and server management thanks to it.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">NAS (edi)</h2>

<p>Edi was built to address the fact that I use multiple computers and
operating systems on a daily basis. <a href="http://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a>
has been wonderful to use, and in my opinion easily matches what the
commercial NAS products have to offer. The hardware is based on an <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16813157247">AMD
E350
combo</a>
with 8GB RAM (zfs likes to maintain a large memory cache) and two WD 2TB
drives (mirrored).</p>

<p>This system also hosts glyph. a FreeBSD jail (easily set up with
FreeNAS) that primarily runs my database servers (currently
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>,
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, and
<a href="http://camlistore.org/">Camlistore</a>).</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Desktop (wrex)</h2>

<p>My current desktop/gaming machine has evolved over several generations;
all that remains of the original are the optical drive and the case (it
still has a 3.5&rdquo; floppy drive, but that hasn&rsquo;t been connected in years).
The current hardware is getting a bit old, but it&rsquo;s still performing
well for what I do. Wrex drives all three monitors typically, with
worse-case load being three <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">EVE</a> clients
running at high quality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Phenom II X4 965</li>
<li>16 GB DDR3</li>
<li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16814102999">Radeon HD
7850</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">Development (liara)</h2>

<p>Liara has had a tumultuous past, originally acting as my router. It is a
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item%3DN82E16856119057">Foxconn barebones
E350</a>.
Now I use it whenever I want to play around with an OS/distro &ldquo;on the
metal&rdquo; instead of in a VM. Currently it&rsquo;s running
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/">SteamOS</a>, although
the E350 isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to handle most games. It also makes a
great monitor stand for the fixed-height ASUS monitor (the other one is
adjustable - I plan to get monitor mounts soon TM).</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Laptop (garrus)</h2>

<p>My current portable machine (which I use for most development, when I
can&rsquo;t &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; a MacBook from the office) is a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/05/dell-inspiron-14z-review/">Dell Inspiron 14z
(2011)</a>.
It has had a couple operating systems on it during its life, and
currently dual- boots Windows XP and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Arch
Linux</a>, the latter of which is used 90% of
the time.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Consoles</h2>

<p>I have both an Xbox 360 and a Playstation 3. Most of my social gaming
happens on the 360, while the PS3 is used for its exclusive games (e.g.
<em>The Last of Us</em>) or its superior Netflix interface. I have no intention
to get an Xbox One or a PS4, and will likely focus on PC gaming when the
360 and PS3 become obsolete.</p>

<p>I quickly picked up a Chromecast when it was released, and for \$35 it
is well worth it. I gave up on watching Netflix on it due to various
quirks, but regularly use it for music.</p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Video</h2>

<p>I have three primary monitors, acquired incrementally over the last few
years. The latest acquisition, and centerpiece, is a <a href="http://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-u2713hm/pd">Dell
U2713HM</a> 27&rdquo;
ultrasharp. Flanking it are two ASUS 24&rdquo; monitors. I also have a <a href="http://www.benq.us/product/projector/w1070/">BenQ
W1070</a> 1080p projector,
which is driven (along with a mixed bag of speakers) by a <a href="http://usa.denon.com/us/product/pages/productdetail.aspx?catid%3Davreceivers(denonna">Denon
AVR-3313CI</a>&amp;pid%3Davr3313ci(denonna))
receiver. The primary (zone 1) output also goes to the Dell monitor.
Zone 2 of the receiver goes to the left monitor. The flexibility enabled
by this receiver is amazing!</p>
